Introduction
============

Some of the tools at [London Hackspace](http://london.hackspace.org.uk) are delicate, some
are dangerous, and almost all are expensive.

I hope that by building checklists of things to remember about these tools, we can reduce
damage to both LHS members and LHS property.

Checklists can make a huge difference to even complicated procedures such as surgery. See
[The Checklist Manifesto](http://gawande.com/the-checklist-manifesto) for more information.


About Checklists
================

Checklists *are* meant to be unambiguous, concise, and useful every time you use them. If they are
verbose, unreadable, misleading, or difficult to understand then they won't be used.

They do *not* contain all-encompassing all-inclusive text descriptions, footnotes, and excess information.

Checklists generally assume that the reader knows what they are doing. They act as *reminders* of safe
and effective behaviour.

Checklists are, by their nature, prescriptive rather than descriptive.


Contributing
============

Please contribute! These documents are not authoritative, and I would love
you to add new documents and give your feedback.

Remember, though, that although writing checklists is easy,
writing *effective* checklists is more difficult. It's very easy to create an
unusable checklist that nobody uses, nobody can understand, or which is simply
a waste of time.

Please remove unnecessary things from existing documents if you can!

I always find examples useful - so here's a [checklist from the Space Shuttle program](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/539922main_EVA_134_F_A.pdf)

Every aspect of that document has been thought through - from the obvious content itself, though to
[the font being used](http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/adegani/Flight-Deck_Documentation.pdf)


CSS/HTML Consistency and Auto Build System
==========================================

This project doesn't use a build system or template library yet. Please be careful to keep
file layouts and styles consistent if you change them.

I've created a similar site with templating for my [Squid User's Guide](https://github.com/oskarpearson/squid-users-guide),
but it requires ruby and various ruby libraries for the build. I'll implement it (or something similar)
if the project takes off.
