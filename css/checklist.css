  I really like the Dive Into HTML5 site readability at http://diveintohtml5.info/ so have based my structure on their
  layout. It seems they have put a lot of thought into the word and paragraph spacing. That page is based on
  a "CC-BY-3.0" licence. Thank you, diveintohtml5.info and Mark Pilgrim!

  Notes on typography and letter spacing:

  I've tried to follow the layout from the NASA "ON THE TYPOGRAPHY OF FLIGHT-DECK DOCUMENTATION" document
  (which, ironically, suggests not using all-caps).

  The above document is at http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/adegani/Flight-Deck_Documentation.pdf
  
  As per their readability guidance I've chosen "Gil Sans" as the default font (though most examples in
  their document actually use Helvetica). Many computers don't have Gil Sans, so I've set other
  sans-serif fonts as backups.
  
  (Arial is very similar to Helvetica, and more commonly available -
    see http://ilovetypography.com/2007/10/06/arial-versus-helvetica/ for more info).
  
  I've also tried to ensure that line-spacing leads to easy reading, erring on the side of more
  space between letters.
